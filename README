URL scraper with TOR support, to dynamicly change IPs while scaping.
This is useful in scenarios where you are ratelimited by IP.

To run this you need:
- torctl
- pycurl
- TOR running on 127.0.0.1:9050 with controlport 127.0.0.1:9051


EXAMPLE:

import torscrape

urls = ["http://icanhazip.com/"]*10

def my_handler(url, data):
    print url, data

torscrape.process(urls, my_handler, refresh_ip=1, verbose=True)

RANT:
This would have been a perfect example to put in a class object.
However, Python and multiprocessing does not play well with 
stuff that you put in classes, making it completly impossible to
make a nice OO-design.

Also multiprocessing and keyboard interrupts make me cry.
